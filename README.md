# TASK 1
# Java File Handling Project

This project demonstrates basic file operations in Java — including writing to, reading from, and modifying text files. It showcases how to interact with files using standard Java I/O classes and is ideal for beginners learning file handling concepts.

# TASK 2
# Java Weather REST API Client

This is a simple Java application that fetches and displays current weather data using a public REST API. The project demonstrates how to make HTTP requests, parse JSON responses using Gson, and display the data in a structured format — all managed with Gradle.

- Fetches current weather for a fixed location (Delhi)
- Parses JSON data using Gson
- Displays:
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Wind Speed (km/h)
  - Time of observation

## Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Gradle (build tool)
- Gson library for JSON parsing
- Open-Meteo API
